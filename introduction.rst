Introduction
************

In the final chapter of his famous book *How to Lie with Statistics*, Darrell
Huff tells us that "anything smacking of the medical profession" or published by
scientific laboratories and universities is worthy of our trust -- not
unconditional trust, but certainly more trust than we'd afford the media or
shifty politicians. After all, Huff filled an entire book with the misleading
statistical trickery used in politics and the media, but few people complain
about statistics done by trained professional scientists. Scientists seek
understanding, not ammunition to use against political opponents.

Statistical data analysis is fundamental to science. Open a random page in your
favorite medical journal and you'll be deluged with statistics: *t* tests, *p*
values, proportional hazards models, risk ratios, logistic regressions,
least-squares fits, and confidence intervals.  Statisticians have provided
scientists with tools of enormous power to find order and meaning in the most
complex of datasets, and scientists have embraced them with glee.

They have not, however, embraced statistics *education*, and most undergraduate
programs in the sciences require no statistical training whatsoever.

Since the 1980s, researchers have described numerous statistical fallacies and
misconceptions in the popular peer-reviewed scientific literature, and have
found that many scientific papers -- perhaps more than half -- fall prey to
these errors. Inadequate statistical power renders many studies incapable of
finding what they're looking for; multiple comparisons and misinterpreted *p*
values cause numerous false positives; flexible data analysis makes it easy to
find a correlation where none exists. The problem isn't fraud but poor
statistical education -- poor enough that some scientists conclude that most
published research findings are probably false.\ :cite:p:`Ioannidis:2005bw`

What follows is a list of the more egregious statistical fallacies regularly
committed in the name of science. It assumes no knowledge of statistical
methods, since many scientists receive no formal statistical training. And be
warned: once you learn the fallacies, you will see them *everywhere.* Don't be
alarmed. This isn't an excuse to reject all modern science and return to
bloodletting and leeches -- it's a call to improve the science we rely on.

I've tried my best, but inevitably this guide will contain errors and
omissions. If you spot an error, have a question, or know a common fallacy I've
missed, email me at stats at refsmmat dot com.
