Statistics Done Wrong
=====================

The woefully complete guide
---------------------------

*by* `Alex Reinhart <http://www.refsmmat.com>`__

If you're a practicing scientist, you probably use statistics to analyze your
data. From basic *t* tests and standard error calculations to Cox proportional
hazards models and geospatial kriging systems, we rely on statistics to give
answers to scientific problems.

This is unfortunate, because most of us don't know how to do statistics.

*Statistics Done Wrong* is a guide to the most popular statistical errors and
slip-ups committed by scientists every day, in the lab and in peer-reviewed
journals. Many of the errors are prevalent in vast swathes of the published
literature, casting doubt on the findings of thousands of papers. *Statistics
Done Wrong* assumes no prior knowledge of statistics, so you can read it before
your first statistics course or after thirty years of scientific practice.

Dive in. Read the whole guide online, or get the `PDF copy
<StatisticsDoneWrong.pdf>`__ for your tablet or dead tree printing device.
